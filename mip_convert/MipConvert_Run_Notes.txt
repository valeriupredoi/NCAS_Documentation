Running an example
===================

1. Configuration file: mip_convert.cfg
======================================
Sections to be changed example:
[COMMON]
metadata_dir: /group_workspaces/jasmin/ncas_cms/valeriu/mip_convert_test
data_dir: /group_workspaces/jasmin/ncas_cms/valeriu/mip_convert_test

The CMOR tables are stored in:
[cmor_setup]
inpath: ${COMMON:metadata_dir}/cmor/Tables

--> this dir must contain the CMIP6_CV.json and a whole bunch of CMIP6 json files for  variables:
one way I found is to git clone the CMOR set from https://github.com/PCMDI/cmor

git clone https://github.com/PCMDI/cmor.git

2. input/output
===============
mip_converts used input/ as the in-dir (needs to be created!)
the config file stores this info in
[request]
sourcedir: ${COMMON:data_dir}/input

3. Download a pp file
=====================
I got one from Grenville:

cp /group_workspaces/jasmin/ncas_cms/grenville/archive/u-an561/19781201T0000Z/an561a.pm1978dec.pp .
mkdir input/u-an561a
cp an561a.pm1978dec.pp input/u-an561a

Change suite id in cfg file:
suite_id: u-an561a

abcde is the suite identifier and is a dir, needs a subdir called apm (that again doesnt
get created automotically pfff).

4. Hacks to work with a non-CMIP6 compliant
============================================
- change variable in cfg file to va;
- changed CMIP6_Amon.json -> va -> from plev19 to plev17
- changed CMIP6_coordinate.json -> plev19 to plev17 and removed 50k and 10k entries
   >> this didn't quite work for two reasons: levels 100 and 500 are not found so I replaced them with duplicates of 1000
                                                          the name plev17 has to appear for *all* the variables in CMIP6_Amon.json (puzzled as to why since I'm asking only for va)
