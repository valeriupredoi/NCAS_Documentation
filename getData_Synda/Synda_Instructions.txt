1. Get data
------------
Important message from ESGF server admins: ATTENTION: We have completed the rename of this ESGF server to esgf-node.llnl.gov from pcmdi.llnl.gov. 
All pcmdi.llnl.gov openids have become esgf-node.llnl.gov for the server name (needed for manual entry in a wget script execution).

Several data nodes are still in the process of updating their configuration to account for the server rename. Until complete, there might 
still be issues in accessing data at some sites. We recommend trying replica data (if available) in the meantime and apologize for the inconvenience. 

The easiest way to get structured data is using synda.
NOTE: you can download individual .nc data files straight from the website https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/
using the search criterion and adding that to the My Data Cart, then navigating to the cart, checking the box against the type of data you want, 
click Show Files then clicking on the HTTPServer. Pre-requisites for data download: have an openID AND being registered with a CMIP5 group (either 
Research or Commercial), see below.

   1.1 openID and group
   --------------------
   openID is a unique non-centralized identifier that allows identity checks over https:// or proxy servers (example https://ceda.ac.uk/openid/valeriu). 
   See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenID for further details about the protocol. 
   When you register for CEDA, they will create an openID for you, see http://help.ceda.ac.uk/article/1.-ceda-account
   After that, you will have to register for a working group - CMIP5 Research in this case, go here https://esgf-node.jpl.nasa.gov/ac/list/ and sign up!
   After this step, you will be able to log in and see your profile and group affiliation (registration is done automatically to the group, pending succesful registration
   for CEDA).

   1.2 Synda
   ---------
   Synda is a data search, visualization and download terminal-based tool that is easy to use as opposed to search and download from the ESGF sites. 
   Installation and usage steps:

   - Install the tool:

   wget --no-check-certificate https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Prodiguer/synda/master/sdc/install.sh
   chmod +x ./install.sh
   ./install.sh

   
   - Add lines below in your shell configuration file (e.g. '.bashrc') to set the paths correctly

   export ST_HOME=$HOME/sdt
   export PATH=$ST_HOME/bin:$PATH

   - Edit credentials file to set openid and password (ESGF credential)

   vi $ST_HOME/conf/credentials.conf

   NOTE: Change the user name in the openID to the true CEDA user name that you have and not the FIRSTNAME.FAMILYNAME that showes up in your openID !!!

   - Synda usage
   synda intro | more -> gives you a working example of how to search and download data
   synda certificate --help -> prompts you to finding/recreating/debugging the grid certificate (cert is in sdt/tmp/.esg)
   synda install [FILENAME] -> downloads the data file [FILE] and puts it in sdt/data
   synda queue -> monitor the download, log files are found in sdt/log (transfer.log tells you about the download)
   synda reset -> cancel downloads
   synda daemon start -> start the download daemon
   synda --help -> help function (executables are in sdt/bin)

   NOTE: synda uses myproxyclient. Authentication issues may be related to this bug: https://github.com/Prodiguer/synda/issues/63
   To verify your myproxyclient works fine use a command e.g.

   python ~/sdt/lib/python2.7/site-packages/myproxy/script.py logon -b -T logon -b -T -s slcs1.ceda.ac.uk -l valeriu -o ./credentials.pem

   or

   myproxyclient logon -b -T logon -b -T -s slcs1.ceda.ac.uk -l valeriu -o ./credentials.pem

   to create a temporary certificate. To note is that myproxyclient comes packaged and gets installed automatically by installing synda, so does
   pip, wheel and python (which python: ~/sdt/bin/python, python -V: 2.7.1., and this is not ideal since this python version does not have the NumPy and SciPy modules.

   1.3 Practical example for ESMVal data
   --------------------------------------
   ESMVal namelist files (e.g. nml/namelist_Emmons.xml) contain a <model/> line of sorts:

   CMIP5 MPI-M MPI-ESM-LR historical Amon r1i1p1

   Pass this to synda as search variables:

   synda search CMIP5 MPI-M MPI-ESM-LR historical Amon r1i1p1

   then look for the specific file variables (here tro3):

   synda search -f cmip5.output1.MPI-M.MPI-ESM-LR.historical.mon.atmos.Amon.r1i1p1.v20120315 tro3
   synda install cmip5.output1.MPI-M.MPI-ESM-LR.historical.mon.atmos.Amon.r1i1p1.v20120315.tro3_Amon_MPI-ESM-LR_historical_r1i1p1_200001-200512.nc

   Done!

   NOTE: if, for some reason, the installation (download) is queued for long (synda queue - see waiting for a lot of time and no log entry in ~/sdt/log/transfer.log)
   then you can just get the file in your local directory by:

   synda get cmip5.output1.MPI-M.MPI-ESM-LR.historical.mon.atmos.Amon.r1i1p1.v20120315.tro3_Amon_MPI-ESM-LR_historical_r1i1p1_200001-200512.nc

   1.4 Difference between 'get' and 'install' (from the developers)
   ----------------------------------------------------------------
   The 'install' command adds the file(s) into a queue, and returns. Then, the synda daemon running in background checks the queue, and downloads the file(s).

   The 'get' command starts the download directly in foreground, and doesn't return until the download is complete.

   Using the 'install' command gives more control over the download process (priority, error management, checksum control, start/stop, post-processing), which is usefull to manage a large number of files.

   With the 'get' command, there is no daemon involved. It is useful to download a small number of files, and for testing.


   Regarding your file not being downloaded with 'install' command,
it may be caused by:

   A- other files have higher priority and the file is still in 'waiting' state
   B- the download have failed and the file is in 'error' state
(one reason may be the integrity control indeed)


   You can check the file status using 'show' command

   e.g.
   synda show pr_day_HadGEM2-ES_1pctCO2_r1i1p1_18891201-18991130.nc


   If the download failed, you should find information about the error in logfiles.

   1.5 Configuration and change of data server
   -------------------------------------------
   synda config will print out the configuration setup and you will see what config file the local synda uses
   ~/sdt/conf/sdt.conf can be changed to query different data nodes and also the search api's

   1.6 Synda find locally
   -----------------------
   synda list -f FILE_NAME will look for FILE_NAME file locally
   synda list will print out all the available data locally
